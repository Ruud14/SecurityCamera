# Raspberry Pi security camera system.

A Raspberry Pi camera system with a live video feed, motion detection system, H.264 mp4 recording capabilities and a storage management system with support for remote storage. <br>
The recorder supports pre-motion frame recording and no internet environments (e.g. Wildlife cameras). 

Confirmed working on Raspberry Pi 3b, 3b+, 4. Other versions will probably work, but they haven't been tested.


### Features


| Feature       |                       |
| ------------- |:-------------                                                                                                       |
| - Live low-bandwidth **H.264 Streaming** to a local web page.          |       
| - Advanced **motion detection** system that **records H.264 .mp4 videos** when motion is detected.               |
| - Even frames from before the motion triggering event are recorded, so everything will be on video.              |
| - Detection sensitivity, recording length, and much more is all easily user configurable.           |
| - Storage management system that **automatically removes the oldest recordings when the storage is almost full.**         |
| - Recordings can be sent to a separate storage device on the network.          |
| - As long as local storage is used, the camera doesn't require an internet connection. So it **can be used as a wildlife camera.**          |
| - Support for **multiple cameras**.          |
| - The recordings and the live stream can be viewed from a Django web page.       |


### Installation guide
- [Install the Raspberry Pi OS on your Raspberry Pi.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/)
*On the Raspberry Pi:*
- Connect the camera and enable it in the `sudo raspi-config` menu.
- Install OpenCV by running the following commands:
  - `sudo apt update`
  - `sudo apt install python3-opencv`
  - To verify the installation, import the cv2 module and print the OpenCV version:
    - `python3 -c "import cv2; print(cv2.__version__)"`
  - If this outputs a version higher or equal to `3.0.0` you are good to go.
- [Install ffmpeg with h.264 support](http://jollejolles.com/installing-ffmpeg-with-h264-support-on-raspberry-pi/). (This step is only neccessary if you want the recordings to be in h264 .mp4 format.)
- Clone this repository (You might need to install git first: `sudo apt install git`):
  - `cd ~`
  - `git clone https://github.com/Ruud14/SecurityCamera.git`
  
### How to run
- Assuming you are in the cloned repository directory, **you can run the full script by running `python3 main.py`**. But first make sure all necessary packages are installed: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` _(python 3.11+ might additionally require [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75608323/how-do-i-solve-error-externally-managed-environment-every-time-i-use-pip-3))_.
- If the default settings don't fit your needs, you should follow the *configuration guide* below.
- Stream:
    - The live stream can be accessed on `http://<local_pi_ip>:8000/index.html` as long as `streamer_active` is set to `true` in the configuration file. Don't forget to replace `<local_pi_ip>` with the local IP address of your Raspberry Pi.
- Storage:
    - If `storage_option` is set to `local` (default), the recordings will be stored in the `local_recordings_output_path` directory (assuming `recorder_active` is set to `true`).
    - If `storage_option` is set to be the IP address of another storage device on the network, you should follow the *Remote storage receiver* guide below the *Configuration guide*. 
- Playback:
    - Recordings can be played using pretty much any modern video player or web browser (assuming `convert_h264_to_mp4` is set to `true`).
    - Recordings can also be watched using [this](https://github.com/Ruud14/Django-Camera-View-And-Playback) Django web page. (assuming `convert_h264_to_mp4` is set to `true`).
- Run at startup:
    - Automatically running `main.py` at startup can be achieved with i.a [chronjobs](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cronjob).

### Remote storage receiver

**This part is only necessary for users that want to use remote storage!**

If you want your recordings to be stored on another storage device on the network, you should do the following: <br>
<br>
On the Raspberry Pi Camera:
- In `config.json`:
    -  Change the value of `storage_option` to the local IP address of the storage device e.g. `192.168.x.x.`
 
On the Storage device:
- Clone the contents of the `recordings_receiver` directory.
- Run `python3 recordings_receiver.py`. 
- The receiver can be configured in `config.json` which looks something like this:
```json
{
  "recordings_output_path": "./recordings/",
  "max_storage_capacity": 25
}
```
The values can be changed according to the table below:

| Name | Description | Type | Required |  Default value |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  `recordings_output_path` |  The directory where recordings will be stored. |  String | Yes  | `./recordings/` |
|  `max_storage_capacity` |  The maximum storage capacity that the recordings can occupy in Gigabytes. If this value is about to be exceeded, the oldest recordings will be removed. |  Integer | Yes  | `25` |

- Automatically running `recordings_receiver.py` at startup can be achieved with i.a [chronjobs](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cronjob).
